# -- SUMMARY: modified export SELECT statement (readable version below)
# --
# -- MAIN PRINCIPLES:
# --      1. sliding 48 hour window to meet ESRI requirement for hosted services
# --      2. in-place, device-specific conversion to uSv/h
# --      3. basic sanity filtering on bad data that would otherwise break ArcGIS processes
# --      4. removal of unnecessary fields.  technically captured_at, value, unit, and device_id could be
# --         eliminated as well, and are only kept for future metadata support.  created_at is used for record
# --         insersion and lat/lon/dre and the necessary x/y/z data values.
# --
# -- NOTES:
# --      1. a NULL device_id indicates a bGeigie log import
# --      2. +/- 85.05 degrees latitude is the maximum permissible extent for a Web mercator projection
# --      3. (0,0) is a valid coordinate in theory, but not in reality for this data
# --      4. although 99%+ of the data is from bGeigies, new device_ids must be manually entered and the
# --         max id increased to be translated correctly
# --      5. if updating, keep the readable version of the SQL below in sync with the one-liner executed at the top!
# --      6. Rounding: factor of 1/350 means max effective resolution of ~0.002 uSv/h for most all data.
# --                   therefore, can be rounded to 3 decimal places without loss of precision.
# --                   (2013-06-16 ND: temporarily removed to isolate issue with no rows returned)
