# Maps #

Maps provide a convenient way for users to organize and collect measurements.

Measurements can be added to a map when they're created using the `map_id` parameter, or can be added to a map after the fact using the `/api/maps/:id/measurement/:id/add` endpoint.

A measurement may belong to more than one map.
