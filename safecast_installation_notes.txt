These are installation notes for getting a development environment for Safecast set up on a fresh Mountain Lion machine. 
YMMV.

I installed:

Homebrew:
http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/go)"

Command Line Tools for Xcode
https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action

Git:
$ brew install git

Install the app:
$ git clone git@github.com:Safecast/safecastapi.git

Install rbenv:
(instructions on https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/)

Install ruby-build:
https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build

Install autoconf:
$ brew install autoconf

Install Ruby 1.9.3 with the falcon GC patch (applies to 1.9.3-p327):
https://gist.github.com/burke/1688857

Install pg gem:
$ env ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64" gem install pg

Disable Rdoc and RI in rubygems:
echo "gem: --no-rdoc --no-ri" > ~/.gemrc

Install bundler:
gem install bundler


Install Postgresql:
$ brew install postgresql
(with notes from https://coderwall.com/p/1mni7w)

Need to Add PostgreSQL User
pgAdmin3 is a helpful GUI client: http://www.pgadmin.org/download/

  Create a user called 'safecast' with the rights needed to create the dev, test, nad prod databases.
  Confirm the database and user settings in the applications config/database.yml file match your database settings.

  To start postgres at login:
  $ ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/postgresql/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents

  Or to start it on demand:
  $ pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres -l /usr/local/var/postgres/server.log start
  or with launchctl:
  $ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist
  
  Or the lunchy gem can also be used as an alternate on OS X
  $ gem install lunchy
  $ mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
  $ cp /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.2.1/homebrew.mxcl.postgresql.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
  
  PostgreSQL can then be started with:
  $ lunchy start postgres

PostGIS PostgreSQL extension is also required.
  
  Can install with Homebrew by running 'brew install postgis'
    It's extremely important to run all system updates prior to trying to install PostGIS.
    
    Also upgrade and upgrade Hombebrew as well
    $ brew upgrade
    $ brew update
  
  Next run 'brew doctor' and ensure all warnings and errors have been fixed.
    This includes installing and running the updated versions of Xcode and Command Line Tools.
    After all updates are complete and errors and warnings with brew doctor have been corrected install PostGIS.
    
  Once PostGIS is installed it will need to be loaded in PostgreSQL and a schema template needs  to be created.
    I followed the following steps however the PostgreSQL documentation also have additional details.
    http://postgis.net/docs/postgis_installation.html#make_install_postgis_extensions
    
    $ createdb template_postgis
    $ createlang plpgsql template_postgis
    $ psql -d template_postgis -f /usr/local/Cellar/postgresql/9.3.3/share/postgresql/extension/postgis--2.1.1.sql 

  Create and migrate the databases
  $ rake db:create RAILS_ENV=development
  $ rake db:create RAILS_ENV=test
  $ rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development
  
  Note: If you receive an error stating the "geography" data type is not found then the PostGIS extension is not correctly loaded.
  
Add /usr/local/bin to $PATH in .bash_profile


Install pow:
curl get.pow.cx | sh

Install powify:
gem install powify
rbenv rehash

Set up safecast.dev:
powify create safecast

Then Follow instructions on github.com/safecast/safecastapi
